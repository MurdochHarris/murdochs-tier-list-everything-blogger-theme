# Murdoch's Tier List Everything — Blogger Theme

![Screenshot of Murdoch's Tier List Everything](Images/MurdochsTierListEverythingScreenshot.png)

A custom **Blogger theme** for [Murdoch's Tier List Everything](https://murdochstierlisteverything.blogspot.com/) — one of many autological projects by Murdoch Harris, where he categorizes as much of the universe as possible into tier lists.

This theme is tailored for clarity, elegance, and humor — blending a dark neon-cyber aesthetic with retro literary typography to reflect the obsessive spirit of ranking everything, including the act of ranking itself.

## 🧠 About the Project

*Murdoch’s Tier List Everything* is an autological venture — a project about projects, a ranking of rankings, an attempt to impose structure on chaos by compulsively tier-listing the world. The theme itself is part of that recursive ethos: ranking as design, and design as documentation.
