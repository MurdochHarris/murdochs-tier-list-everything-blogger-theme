# Murdoch's Tier List Everything — Blogger Theme

![Screenshot of Murdoch's Tier List Everything](Images/MurdochsTierListEverythingScreenshot.png)

A custom **Blogger theme** for [Murdoch's Tier List Everything](https://murdochstierlisteverything.blogspot.com/) — one of Murdoch Harris' autological projects, where he attempts to categorize as much of the universe as possible into tier lists.

This theme is designed for clarity, elegance, and obsessive categorization — blending a dark neon-cyber aesthetic with retro literary typography to reflect the recursive spirit of ranking everything, including the act of ranking itself.

## 🧠 About the Project

**Murdoch’s Tier List Everything** is an autological experiment in meta-categorization — a blog that tier-lists not just things, but the idea of tier-listing itself. The theme follows suit: expressive, functional, and recursive by nature.
